        <h2>Who</h2>
        <p>I am Axel Maysonet, and I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, 
            from the University of Central Florida (Go Knights!!). Raised in Florida and
             Puerto Rico, I'm fluent in both English and Spanish. I'm passionate about 
             helping others, being a leader and I love computers. With a vested interest 
             into the computers today, you'll always find me tinkering and experimenting to 
             build the technology of the future.</p>

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>I'm Axel and I love coming up with new creative solutions. With a degree in Computer Engineering,
             I developed a keen interest in computer and web technologies and their potential for connecting
              people and creating immersive experiences. This led me to explore web development, mobile app 
              development, database management frameworks, computer archeticture technologies, and machine 
              learning algorithms. I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects including Flutter, 
              React, Fushion360 PCB, C, Verilog, and more.</p>

            <p>Responsible for PCB design and the Mobile Application developement, 
                this group project was able to create a protype for a modular robotic 
                centipede platfrom. This prototype succesfully demonstrated the feasibility, 
                of utilizing a modular centipede in mobile robotics. With ability to attach and 
                detach myriapod segments with ease, the robot is incredinly versitile in its 
                ability to add functionality tailored to any client. My responsibilities were to 
                design electrical schematics and version 1 of the printed circuit board on the 
                centipede. As well as create and design, using Flutter, the Android application that is how the robot
                is remote controlled (via Bluetooth). </p>

            <p>An Android application designed in Flutter to be a way of gamifying tasks and managing them.
                The app uses a point system to vary levels of importance/urgency, an includes user input
                information such at due dates and ingredients. As well as being a task manager the app also
                manages recipes and tracks which ingredients you were able to get ahold of in the tasks screen.

            <p>Using Computer Vision techniques, I created a progam in Python that is able to take any image with 
                a sheet of paper and crop it out and resize to document size. First grayscalling the image, then 
                turning that into a binary image that converts every pixel to either 100% black or 100% white. Afterwards
                detect contours to filter the image to remove nose and focus on the document. Then, using corner 
                detection, finding the corners (and their coordinates) of the paper. With these acknowledged, we can then 
                warp the image to our liking, in this case an upright triangle. Although this uses traditional computer 
                vision techniques, future versions could be trained on image data (machine learning) rather than 
                relying on filtering.
