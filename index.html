        <h2>Who</h2>
        <p>I am Axel Maysonet, and I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, 
            from the University of Central Florida (Go Knights!!). Raised in Florida and
             Puerto Rico, I'm fluent in both English and Spanish. I'm passionate about 
             helping others, being a leader and I love computers. With a vested interest 
             into the computers today, you'll always find me tinkering and experimenting to 
             build the technology of the future.</p>

            <p>Responsible for PCB design and the Mobile Application developement, 
                this group project was able to create a protype for a modular robotic 
                centipede platfrom. This prototype succesfully demonstrated the feasibility, 
                of utilizing a modular centipede in mobile robotics. With ability to attach and 
                detach myriapod segments with ease, the robot is incredinly versitile in its 
                ability to add functionality tailored to any client. My responsibilities were to 
                design electrical schematics and version 1 of the printed circuit board on the 
                centipede. As well as create and design, using Flutter, the Android application that is how the robot
                is remote controlled. </p>

            <p>An Android application designed in Flutter to be a way of gamifying tasks and managing them.
                The app uses a point system to vary levels of importance/urgency, an includes user input
                information such at due dates and ingredients. As well as being a task manager the app also
                manages recipes and tracks which ingredients you were able to get ahold of in the tasks screen.

            <p>Developed in C, this program is made to simulate the movement of the cache within a CPU's hierarchy
                using cache replacement policies like LRU (Least Recently Used), and FIFO to parse when data is accesed
                or moved.
