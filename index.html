            <h2>Hi, I'm Axel Maysonet</h2>
            <p>With a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, 
                I'm equipped to take on any challenge in Today's rapidly evolving technology.
                Born and Raised in Florida and Puerto Rico, I'm fluent in both English and Spanish. I'm passionate about 
                        helping others, being a leader and computers! With a vested interest 
                        into the computers today, you'll always find me tinkering and experimenting to 
                        build the technology of the future.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I love coming up with new creative solutions. Having obtained a degree in Computer Engineering at the
            Univeristy of Central Florida, I was put in a advantageous postion to do just that.
            From electrical circuits of memory, to logic gates, to ones and zeros in binary, to assembly language, 
            to programming with C++ or java, and finally to concepts like path planning, networks, and even machine 
            learning algorithms. I learned it all during the pursuit of my degree. I'm fascinated with having that 
            level of understanding for today's technology.
             I developed a keen interest in computer hardware and web technologies and their potential for connecting
              people and creating immersive experiences. 
               This led me to explore PCB design, web development, mobile app 
              development, database management frameworks, computer archeticture technologies, and machine 
              learning algorithms. I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects including Flutter, 
              React, Fushion360 PCB, C, Verilog, and more.</p>
